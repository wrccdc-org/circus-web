      <h2>What is the CIRCUS Competition?</h2>
      <p>
        Teams receive a client scenario and forensic artifacts from a compromised environment.
        Your job is to determine what happened, document how it happened, and communicate clear
        recommendations. You'll be scored on the completeness of your reports, professionalism,
        recommendations, and presentations.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0.5rem;">
        CIRCUS emphasizes not just technical analysis, but also evidence handling, chain of
        custody, and clear communication with legal, executive, and non-technical stakeholders.
