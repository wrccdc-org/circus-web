      <p class="page-subheading">
        The CIRCUS Competition gives students the opportunity to demonstrate and sharpen their skills
        in incident response and computer forensics through a realistic client scenario.
      </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          CIRCUS (Collegiate Incident Response Competition for Undergraduate Students) is designed to
          bridge the gap between coursework and the real-world challenges of cyber incident response.
          Teams are tasked with investigating a reported breach against a fictional client, piecing
          together what happened, and presenting clear, defensible findings.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;">
          Students are scored on the completeness of their reports, professionalism, quality of
          recommendations, and their final presentations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What Makes CIRCUS Unique?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A strong emphasis on <strong>process</strong> — not just tools or “flag hunting”.</li>
          <li>Focus on <strong>evidence handling</strong>, chain of custody, and defensible documentation.</li>
          <li>Deliverables that mirror professional work: written findings and oral presentations.</li>
          <li>Judging based on technical depth and clarity for legal, executive, and business audiences.</li>
          <li>A fun, accessible circus theme to keep the environment welcoming and engaging.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>How the Competition Works</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Virtual Phase:</strong> Teams receive a statement of work and forensic images or
            logs from a compromised environment. They conduct analysis, document artifacts, and submit
            a formal incident report.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finals:</strong> Top teams in each division are invited to present their findings
            in person at the finals (currently planned to be hosted at SCALE in Pasadena, CA).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scoring:</strong> Scores combine artifact discovery, written reporting, and the
            quality of the final presentation and Q&amp;A.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
