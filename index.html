        <h2>What is the CIRCUS Competition?</h2>
        <p>
          Teams receive a client scenario and forensic artifacts from a compromised environment.
          Your job is to determine what happened, document how it happened, and communicate clear
          recommendations. You’ll be scored on the completeness of your reports, professionalism,
          recommendations, and presentations.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:0.5rem;">
          CIRCUS emphasizes not just technical analysis, but also evidence handling, chain of
          custody, and clear communication with legal, executive, and non-technical stakeholders.
